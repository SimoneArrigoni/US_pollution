# US_pollution

In this repository we make available the dataset we elaborated for Alaska's pollution (Alaska_dataset.csv), the one we used in our analysis.

We provide also the original dataset (pollution_us_2000_2016.csv)

The file US_pollution_final.rmd contains the script we used to elaborate the data and get the Alaska_dataset.csv file

These files provide the basis for further analysis that will be carried out within the course of Time Series Analysis by Luca Badolato, Simone Arrigoni and Simone Valle.
