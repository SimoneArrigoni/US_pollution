# US_pollution

In this repository we make available the dataset we elaborated for Louisiana's pollution both with weekly and monthly frequency (Louisiana_dataset_weekly.csv and Louisiana_dataset_monthly.csv). 

The file US_pollution_final.rmd (main) contains the script we used to elaborate the data and get the Louisiana_dataset.csv file

Since the original dataset is rather large we provide a zip-file (pollution_us_2000_2016.7z) as well as the link to the source in the main script

These files provide the basis for further analysis that will be carried out within the course of Time Series Analysis by Luca Badolato, Simone Arrigoni and Simone Valle.
